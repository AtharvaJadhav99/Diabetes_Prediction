# Diabetes Detection using Machine Learning Algorithms

This project detects if a person has diabetes or not using  Machine Learning Algorithms.
Using features like blood pressure, insulin level, BMI, Age etc, the machine learning model
detects if the person is diabetic or not.

# Tools and Libraries Used

Python (Programming Language Used)

Pandas, numpy (For data cleaning and Analysis)

matplotlib (For data visualizations)

sklearn (For machine learning models)

Streamlit (For front end development)

# Dataset

The dataset for the project has been taken from Kaggle.  
The dataset link is : https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/uciml/pima-indians-diabetes-database

# Features of the Dataset

Number of times pregnant

Plasma glucose concentration a 2 hours in an oral glucose tolerance test

Diastolic blood pressure (mm Hg)

Triceps skin fold thickness (mm)

2-Hour serum insulin (mu U/ml)

Body mass index (weight in kg/(height in m)^2)

Diabetes pedigree function

Age (years)

Output to Predict: Class variable (0 or 1)
